## 🎯 Objective

To build a regression model that can predict median house values based on California census data. We explore, process, and model real-world data using an industry-grade ML pipeline.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Missing Value Imputation**
- 🏗️ **Feature Engineering** (e.g., ratios, log transformation, geographical clustering)
- 🔧 **Custom Transformers & Pipelines using `FunctionTransformer`**
- 🧠 **Model Comparison**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
- 🔁 **Cross-Validation & Evaluation using RMSE**
- 🌲 **Final model selection: Random Forest Regressor**
- 📈 **Rich Visualizations** using Matplotlib/Seaborn

## 🧪 Models Used

| Model                | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Linear Regression**      | Simple baseline model for comparison           |
| **Decision Tree Regressor** | Captured non-linear patterns, but prone to overfitting |
| **Random Forest Regressor** | Final chosen model due to better generalization |

All models were trained using the same preprocessing pipeline and evaluated using **cross-validated RMSE (CV=10)**.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AriseAk/AIML.git
cd AIML
````

### 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

## ⚠️ Note on Model File

The trained model file (`my_california_housing_model.pkl`) is not included due to GitHub's file size limit (100 MB).
You can retrain and save it locally using the final cells in the notebook.
